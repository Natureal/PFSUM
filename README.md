## Introduction
1. All algorithms including SUM, SUM_w, FSUM, PFSUM, PLDA, and the offline optimal algorithm were implemented in algorithms.py. The offline optimal algorithm is based on dynamic programming, see more details in [1].

2. To reproduce the experiment, run experiment.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook. The generated figures will be stored in folder figs.

## Running Examples
![](run_case1)
![](run_case2)

## Requirements

1. Python >= 3.7

2. Jupyter Notebook
